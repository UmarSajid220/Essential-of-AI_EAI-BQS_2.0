### Actual Coding and understanding the core concepts
- [ ]  Writing First line of code 
		*Solve these to understand the problems in a better way [First code exercises](First%20code%20exercises.md)* 
- [ ] Arithmetic operations
		*Read the details here [Arithmetic operations](Arithmetic%20operations.md)*
- [ ] Commenting
		*Read the details here [Commenting](Commenting.md) and while you are at it, complete this exercise:*
			 Please write a program which prints out the number of minutes in a year. Use Python code to perform the calculation, as in the previous code example.
- [ ] Information from the user
		Learn more about this topic from here [Information from the user](Information%20from%20the%20user.md)
		Solve this exercise as well [Who are you](Who%20are%20you.md)
- [ ] Variables
		In general, variables are like containers to store some data. Data can be some string, some integer or something else entirely.
		Here's how you [Reference a variable](Reference%20a%20variable.md).
		Complete this exercise of [Name and exclamation mark](Name%20and%20exclamation%20mark.md)
- [ ] More than one inputs
		Here's how you handle [More than one input](More%20than%20one%20input.md) in a program
		Solve the next exercises to understand it more deeply [Problems to understand and solve when taking multiple inputs](Problems%20to%20understand%20and%20solve%20when%20taking%20multiple%20inputs.md)
- [ ] Advanced Variables
		Here's a quick guide to learn [More about variables](More%20about%20variables.md)
		Also [Something little complex about variables](Something%20little%20complex%20about%20variables.md) 
- [ ] Float point numbers
		Quick Guide [Float point numbers](Float%20point%20numbers.md), and when you complete this start the [Game of Arithmetic](Game%20of%20Arithmetic.md)
- [ ] Arithmetic operations
		First and foremost cover the [Basics of Arithmetic operations](Basics%20of%20Arithmetic%20operations.md)
		then [Solving arithmetic problems](Solving%20arithmetic%20problems.md)
		Now by [combining the variables and arithmetic concepts](combining%20the%20variables%20and%20arithmetic%20concepts.md)
		And of course... the [Problems to solve by combining the variables and arithmetic operations](Problems%20to%20solve%20by%20combining%20the%20variables%20and%20arithmetic%20operations.md)
