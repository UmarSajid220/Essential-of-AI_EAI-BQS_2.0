You can also put arithmetic operations inside a `print` command. Running it will then print out the result of the operation. For example, the following program

```python
print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)
```


Here is all the operators you'll need to be familiar with to get things up and running:

| Operator | Name           | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition       | x + y   |
| -        | Subtraction    | x - y   |
| *        | Multiplication | x * y   |
| /        | Division       | x / y   |
| %        | Modulus        | x % y   |
| **       | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
| //       | Floor division | x // y  |
