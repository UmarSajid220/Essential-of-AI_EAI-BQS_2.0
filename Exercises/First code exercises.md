## Problem 01
"Seitsemän veljestä" is one of the first novels ever written in Finnish. It is the story of seven orphaned brothers learning to make their way in the world ([read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitsem%C3%A4n_veljest%C3%A4)).

This program is supposed to print out the names of the brothers in alphabetical order, but it's not working quite right yet. Please fix the program so that the names are printed in the correct order.

```python
print("Simeoni")
print("Juhani")
print("Eero")
print("Lauri")
print("Aapo")
print("Tuomas")
print("Timo")
```


## Problem 02
Please write a program which prints out the following lines exactly as they are written here, punctuation and all:

Sample output

```
Row, row, row your boat, 
Gently down the stream. 
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, 
Life is but a dream.
```


## Problem 03
Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks `"` to print out strings. In addition to the double quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks `'`.

This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:

```python

print('"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.')
```

Sample output
	```
	"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.
	```
Please write a program which prints out the following:

**Sample output:**
```
print("Hello there!")
```
