---
## 1. Terminal or CMD

The _Terminal_ (or Command Prompt in Windows) is a text window where you type direct instructions to your computer instead of clicking on icons. It is the most powerful way to talk to your machine because it lets you run programs and move files much faster than using a mouse.

> _Example:_ Instead of opening a folder, finding a file, and right-clicking to delete it, you can just type `rm filename.txt` in the terminal and it disappears instantly.
## 2. WSL Installation

_WSL_ stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, and it is a tool that lets you run a full Linux computer inside your Windows system. Most professional programmers prefer Linux because it is built for coding, and WSL gives you the best of both worlds without needing two separate computers.

> _Step-by-step:_ Open your _PowerShell_ as an Administrator and type `wsl --install`. Once it finishes, restart your computer, and you will have a new "Ubuntu" app ready to use.

> _Example:_ It is like having a "coding superpower" mode that you can turn on whenever you want to work on serious projects while still keeping your Windows games and apps.

## 3. Core Concepts: Python Programming Environment

A _Programming Environment_ is like a digital toolbox that contains everything your computer needs to understand and run your code. For Python, this includes the Python "interpreter" (the brain that reads your code) and any extra tools or libraries you might need for special projects like making games or analyzing data.

> _Example:_ Setting up an environment is like setting up a kitchen; Python is the chef, the libraries are the ingredients, and your computer is the stove that makes everything heat up and work.
## 4. Installing Python and VS Code

_Python_ is the language you write, and _VS Code_ is the smart notebook where you write it. To get started, you download Python from its official website and then install VS Code as your main editor. VS Code is the most popular choice because it helps you find mistakes and suggests words while you type.

> _Step-by-step:_ > 1. Download Python from _python.org_ and make sure to check the box that says _Add Python to PATH_ during setup. 2. Download VS Code from _code.visualstudio.com_ and install it. 3. Inside VS Code, click the "Extensions" icon (it looks like four squares) and search for _Python_ to install the official helper.
## 5. Installing Jupyter in VS Code and Google Colab

_Jupyter_ is a special way to write code where you can see the results of one small part at a time instead of running the whole program at once. You can use it inside _VS Code_ by installing an extension, or you can use _Google Colab_, which runs entirely in your web browser and doesn't require any installation on your computer.

> _Step-by-step:_ > * For _VS Code_: Search for the _Jupyter_ extension in the Extensions menu and click install. Create a file ending in `.ipynb` to start.
> 
> - For _Google Colab_: Simply go to _colab.research.google.com_ and sign in with your Google account. It's ready to go!

## 6. Running First Python Programs

Running your first program is the moment you officially become a coder by telling the computer to display a message. The traditional first step is the _Hello World_ program, which simply shows those words on your screen to prove that everything is set up correctly.

> _Step-by-step:_ Open a new file in VS Code, type `print("Hello World!")`, and click the small "Play" button in the top right corner. You will see the message pop up in the window at the bottom.

> _Example:_ It is like teaching a robot its very first sentence; once it says "Hello World," you know it is listening and ready for harder instructions.

## 7. VCS (Version Control System)

A _Version Control System_ (usually called Git) is a tool that tracks every single change you make to your code. It acts like a giant "Undo" button for your entire project, allowing you to go back to a version that worked if you accidentally break something later on.

> _Example:_ Imagine you are writing a long story. Every time you finish a chapter, you hit "Save Version." If you hate the new ending you wrote, you can just click a button and go back to exactly how the story looked two days ago.
