## Course Introduction

This course provides a structured pathway into the design and development of agentic AI systems. Students will progress from foundational concepts in artificial intelligence to the practical construction of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents capable of reasoning, tool usage, and workflow execution. Emphasis is placed on applied understanding, engineering discipline, and real-world implementation.

Through guided practice, case studies, and incremental system building, participants will learn how modern agent frameworks operate, how large language models interact with environments, and how multi-step decision processes can be automated. By the conclusion of the program, learners will possess the technical clarity required to design, deploy, and evaluate functional AI agents.

## Course Goal

The primary goal of this course is to enable students to design and implement single-agent and multi-agent systems, including ReAct-style architectures, that can autonomously perform **well-defined tasks** through reasoning, planning, memory, and external tool integration.

Graduates of the course will be able to translate problem statements into executable agent workflows, select appropriate models and tools, and build reliable solutions aligned with practical industry needs.
